For our special issue on sex, the Daily Californian is collecting stories to examine where sexual encounters on campus actually happen and what they actually look like. \n\nIf you feel comfortable, please share a time you had a sexual encounter on campus, where it happened, and how it made you feel. We want to provide a safe and anonymous space where you can feel comfortable sharing your own story, however intense, funny, casual, uncomfortable or haunting it may be."},{"type":"map"},{"type":"form"},{"type":"text","text":"\nIâ€™d like to give a special thanks to Avni and Emily for their work on <a href=\"http://projects.dailycal.org/2017/where-we-cry/\">the Where We Cry project</a>, upon which this project is heavily based."}]}
