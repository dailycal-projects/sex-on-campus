At first I didn't expect the conversation to go anywhere, but as we talked, I decided to meet up. Surprisingly, he asked me to meet up on campus in a Lab in Stanley and added that a third person would be watching. I'm not sure why I still thought that was a good idea on my first date but I went through with it. In the end, I didn't regret it and actually became friends with benefits with the guy.

{"message": "I was her GSI the prior year but we had never done anything with each other. We were walking through a bitterly cold Fall campus at 2am. It was the night of Daylight's Savings Time. We traipsed around on the walkways as she pointed out her favorite trees to climb and which buildings she had classes in. She eventually led me down a gully to her favorite spot to smoke weed: a sewer-like graffiti-covered tunnel through which Strawberry Creek snaked. I'd never had sex outdoors so I started making moves. We were wearing our winter clothes: me donning a military-style coat and her wearing her Cal sweater. We dropped our pants down to our knees, keeping our upper half's clothed to retain warmth. The cold air whisked over my hard dick. She bent over, her head facing a lewd graffiti marking on the wall. It didn't go in too easily, but I couldn't blame her. I chalked it up to the weather. I began to get aggressive but with every reckless thrust I would almost get knocked backward into the frigid creek. I found myself frequently regaining my footing on the precarious, roughed-up concrete. This distraction, combined with the freezing brisk air and relatively dry vagina really took me out of it. After 5 minutes or so of ridiculousness, I pulled out, neither of us having cum, and called it quits. We buttoned our pants and climbed back out of the ravine, laughing to ourselves about the silly experience. I thanked her for helping me lose my outdoor virginity and told her we should do it again sometime in a nice, cosy warm bed. She agreed. \n\nWe fucked and came like wild animals the next night.", "lat": 37.87193, "long": -122.256635},
