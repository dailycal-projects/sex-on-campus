As a horny freshman as I was, though, I downloaded Grindr and checked the happenings around campus. I was greeted with a message from a senior who was working on campus at the moment. At first I didn't expect the conversation to go anywhere, but as we talked, I decided to meet up. Surprisingly, he asked me to meet up on campus in a Lab in Stanley and added that a third person would be watching. I'm not sure why I still thought that was a good idea on my first date but I went through with it. In the end, I didn't regret it and actually became friends with benefits with the guy.
